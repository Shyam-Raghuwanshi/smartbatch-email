# Custom Domain Email Configuration - Setup Guide

## üéØ **Solution Overview**

I've implemented a comprehensive custom domain email configuration system for your SmartBatch email marketing platform. This solution gives users maximum flexibility in how they send emails:

### **‚úÖ What's Implemented:**

1. **Email Settings Management** - Users can configure multiple email service providers
2. **Per-Campaign Email Configuration** - Choose different sender addresses for different campaigns  
3. **Flexible Architecture** - Support for Resend, SendGrid, Mailgun, AWS SES, and SMTP
4. **Domain Verification** - Track DKIM, SPF, DMARC setup status
5. **Security** - API keys are encrypted and masked in the UI

---

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture**

### **Database Schema Updates:**
- `emailSettings` table - Store user's email service configurations
- `campaigns.settings.emailConfig` - Per-campaign email overrides
- `emailQueue.metadata` - Track which email settings were used

### **Backend Functions:**
- `emailSettings.ts` - Manage email configurations and test connectivity
- `emailService.ts` - Updated to use custom email settings when sending
- `campaigns.ts` - Include email config in campaign queue creation

### **Frontend Components:**
- `EmailSettingsManager.tsx` - Complete UI for managing email configurations
- Updated `CampaignForm.tsx` - Added email configuration section
- Updated `Settings` page - New "Email Settings" tab

---

## üöÄ **User Flow**

### **1. Initial Setup (One-time)**
1. User goes to Settings ‚Üí Email Settings
2. Clicks "Add Email Configuration"
3. Selects provider (Resend, SendGrid, etc.)
4. Enters:
   - API Key (encrypted and stored securely)
   - Custom domain (e.g., "yourdomain.com")
   - Default from name (e.g., "Your Company")
   - Default from email (e.g., "noreply@yourdomain.com")
5. Optionally adds custom from addresses:
   - `support@yourdomain.com` (for support emails)
   - `marketing@yourdomain.com` (for campaigns)
   - `welcome@yourdomain.com` (for onboarding)
6. Tests configuration with a test email
7. Sets as default if desired

### **2. Campaign Creation (Flexible)**
When creating a campaign, users can:
- Use default email configuration (no setup needed)
- Override the "From Name" for this specific campaign
- Override the "From Email" for this specific campaign  
- Set a custom Reply-To address
- Preview exactly how the email will appear to recipients

### **3. Email Sending (Automatic)**
- System automatically uses the appropriate email configuration
- Falls back to default SmartBatch settings if no custom config
- Properly handles different email service providers
- Maintains full tracking and analytics
