## üîß TECHNICAL DETAILS

### The Root Cause
The error occurs when the email service (`emailService.ts:processEmailQueue`) can't find an email configuration that meets BOTH criteria:
- `isDefault: true` 
- `isActive: true`

### The Fix
The `fixEmailSettingsIssues` function:
1. Gets all user email settings
2. Finds the first one
3. Sets it as `isDefault: true` and `isActive: true`
4. Deactivates other defaults to prevent conflicts
